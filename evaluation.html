					About
				</h3>
				<p>
					A team of three performed a field study evaluating four people’s subjective emotional and affective experiences using the whole body interface video game Wii Sports Tennis.
				</p>

			<div class="work-header-right">
				<!-- <div class="check"></div> -->
				<h3>
					Main Take Away
				</h3>
				<p>
					I've learned about evaluating users' emotional responses when they are interacting with the interface, as well as an interview technique for extracting users' emotional statements.

		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<div class="center-stuff">	
			<img src="img/evaluation-graph.png" alt="evaluation problem">
		</div>
		<p>
			As we can see in body interface video games, traditional design evaluations such as usability evaluation and heuristic evaluation have been defining a new generation of user interfaces that are moved off the flat screen and into the physical world . These design evaluations, however, focus on performance and neglects people’s emotional responses. Therefore, we performed a field study to evaluate the players’ emotional and affective experiences while they are playing the full body interface game, Wii sports tennis.
		</p>

		<h2>Method</h2>
		<figure>
<!-- 			<figcaption>
				A diagram that describes how we performed study
			</figcaption> -->
			<img src="img/schedule-evaluation.png" alt="study schedule">
		</figure>
		<p>
			We set up the game with two video cameras - one for capturing what the player sees, and the other for capturing a participant and evaluators. Participants were given 5 minutes to practice the game so that they can be familiar with it. The actual game play session lasted for about 5 - 8 mins and entire session was recorded. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We used Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire and cued-recall debrief to evaluate the emotional and affective experiences of participants as well as to explore the design of the game.
		</p>
		
		<figure>
<!-- 			<figcaption>
				IMI questionnaire and cued-recall debrief forms we used
			</figcaption> -->
			<img src="img/questions.png" alt="questionnaires">
		</figure>

		<p>
			Immediately after the game was played, participants filled out an IMI questionnaire and it was followed by the cued-recall debrief session. While playing the video of the participants playing the game, they sat down with an evaluator, and were asked to speak freely about any interaction of the game even though the evaluator was only interested in participant’s affective experiences. The cued-recall debrief session was recorded for data extraction and qualitative data interpretation.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Finding</h2>
		<p>
			There were 3 positive aspects about the game that were found from cued-recall debrief,
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li class="finding-title">
						Accuracy of character arm movement 
					</li>
					<li>
						Participants were satisfied with how their arm movements were well recognized by the sensor and applied to the character movements.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li class="finding-title">
						Easy to pick up controller
					</li>
					<li>
						Participants easily learned how to play the game by moving the controllers.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li class="finding-title">
						Easy to track ball movement
					</li>
					<li>
						Participants could continuously play the game, preparing them for the next movement as soon as they hit the ball.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<!-- <p>
			There was one positive aspect about the screen layout that was found from cued-recall debrief - it was very easy and clear for our participants to track the ball movement, hence they could continuously play the game preparing for the next movement as soon as they hit the ball.
		</p> -->		
		 
		<h2>Suggestion</h2>
		<p>
			The improvements that we suggest for better experience of the game are,
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li class="finding-title">
							Clearly indicate about skipping replay
						</li>
						<li>
							Our cued-recall debrief suggests that participants were very distracted when they had to watch the replay every time they win. Though they could skip the replay, some of them didn't realize it. Hence, indicating this functionality on the screen will make players easily recognize that they can skip the replay if they want to.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li class="finding-title">
							Display score throughout the game play
						</li>
						<li>
							The game is only showing the score during the replay. Some of our participants felt disappointed when they couldn’t remember the score, which suggests that it would be better to display score throughout the game.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<h2>Take Away</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Prior to this study, my design evaluations were focused on user performance. However, with this study, I've learned about evaluating the user's emotional and affective responses when they are interacting with the interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				I've learned a new interview technique that is more effective for extracting data about participants' emotional statements for quantitative and qualitative assessments.
			</li>
